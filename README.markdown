# Survived Mars, Now What?

... is a custom-built Stellaris mod to bridge the gap between my Surviving Mars streams and my Stellaris streams.

Features:

* An eponymous origin, which when chosen, features:
    * Start with Mars already terraformed to a desert planet and colonized
    * Start with Science and Constructor ships named after my rockets in Surviving Mars (incl. extra science ship)
    * Mars has a +100% research boost modifier. If you put them on the same time scale, research is mind-boggingly fast in Surviving Mars compared to Stellaris, so I felt like I had to bring that up.
    * Three whole paragraphs of lore

## How do I install it?

Go to the `mod` folder inside your [Stellaris data folder][pcgw], or create it if it doesn't exist. Copy both `survived_mars.mod` and the `survived_mars` directory there. Open the Stellaris launcher and add "Survived Mars, Now What" to your initial playset or a playset of your choice.

## Why isn't this on the Steam workshop?

It's a funny personal mod for building out stream lore. I don't think anyone wants to play with it on, I'm just putting it here in hope that it helps someone else trying to mod a clausewitz game.
